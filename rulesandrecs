#RULES and RECS 

Rules
#ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions
    # In main.cpp all the exceptions have been handled
#ERR55-CPP. Honor exception specifications
    #The exception specifications have been honored in main.cpp such that there is neither an implementation defined termination nor an abnormal termination
#ERR56-CPP. Guarantee exception safety
    #The exception safety has been guaranteed in main.cpp. The errors and exceptional situations have been handled properly.
#ERR34-C. Detect errors when converting a string to a number
    #In the file dbhandler.cpp, the error conditions have been detected and addressed when the function pertaining to the same is called.
#FIO47-C. Use valid format strings
    #Valid format strings like fprintf have been used in dbhandler.cpp
#FIO38-C. Do not copy a FILE object
    #The hash files include file objects. To prevent access violation, we haven't copied in file object. 
#ERR33-C. Detect and handle standard library errors
    #To prevent unexpected and undefined behaviour all errors have been detected and handled.
#ERR53-CPP. Do not reference base classes or class data members in a constructor or destructor function-try-block handler

#FIO42-C. Close files when they are no longer needed
    #All the files are closed when they are no longer needed to ensure proper termination of the program.
#FIO46-C. Do not access a closed file
    #This is an undefined behaviour. We are not accessing any file that is closed.
#ERR50-CPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program
    #It can lead to an indeterminate state of the files, so the function calls have been made explicitly and the programs have not been terminated abruptly.



Recs
#FIO01-C. Be careful using functions that use file names for identification
    #Files have been accessed through file descriptors and file pointers wherever possible
#FIO06-C. Create files with appropriate access permissions
    #Creating a file with insufficiently restrictive access permissions may allow an unprivileged user to access that file. We have ensured flags for the same.
#FIO24-C. Do not open a file that is already open
    #Opening a file that is already open has implementation-defined behavior. Multiple copies of the same file opened at a given time leads to the same.
#FIO15-C. Ensure that file operations are performed in a secure directory
    #The secret directory is the dbhandler which no one other than the user or administrator has ability to create, rename, delete or manipulate.
