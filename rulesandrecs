#RULES and RECS 

Rules
#FIO30-C. Exclude user input form format strings
# termios?

#FIO42-C. Close files when they are no longer needed
# We have made sure that this rule is obeyed consistently in code.
# for eg., for each opening of the database file geemail.db, a corresponding close command has been put in.

#FIO46-C. Do not access a closed file
# similar to the above rule, we have only accessed the database files after opening it.

#ERR30-C. Set errno to zero before calling a library function known to set errno, and check errno only after function returns a value indicating failure.
# In our dbHandler.cpp code, we have explicitly set the value of zErrMsg to zero before calling the corrsponding sqlite3 function. Also in accordance with this rule,
we check the zErrMsg only afetr function returns the value indicating failure.

#ERR50-CPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program
# In our code we've consistently taken care of this rule. We have thrwon an exception for all cases and caught these exceptions.
*In main.cpp we have ensured that different kinds of erros and exceptions are properly accounted for.

#ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions
#ERR55-CPP. Honor exception specifications
#ERR56-CPP. Guarantee exception safety
#ERR34-C. Detect errors when converting a string to a number


#ERR33-C. Detect and handle standard library errors
#ERR53-CPP. Do not reference base classes or class data members in a constructor or destructor function-try-block handler




Recs
#FIO01-C. Be careful using functions that use file names for identification. 
#FIO06-C. Create files with appropriate access permissions
#FIO24-C. Do not open a file that is already open
#FIO15-C. Ensure that file operations are performed in a secure directory
FIO05-C. Identify files using multiple file attributes
ERR00-C. Adopt and implement a consistent and comprehensive error-handling policy
ERR04-C. Choose an appropriate termination strategy
ERR05-C. Application-independent code should provide error detection without dictating error handling
ERR07-C. Prefer functions that support error checking over equivalent functions that don't
